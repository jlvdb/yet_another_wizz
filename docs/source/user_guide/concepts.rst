Concepts
========

The two most important design concepts of yet_another_wizz are:

- spatial regions, called **patches** and
- disk **caching**.

While the former is mostly concerned with the performance of the correlation
function measurements, the latter is import for estimating uncertainties. The
next pages give some additional insights in how to use them optimally for a
clustering redshift analysis.
