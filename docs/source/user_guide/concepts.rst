The two most important design concepts of *yet_another_wizz* are:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    concepts/patches
    concepts/caching

Patches are important to compute uncertainties and covariances and both concepts
can have a big impact on the performance of the code. The next pages give some
additional insights in how to use them optimally for a clustering redshift
analysis.
