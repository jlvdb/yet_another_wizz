Command line tools
==================

.. Note::

    This is a stub, more content coming soon.

The *yet_another_wizz* package can be used with a command line tool called ``yaw_cli``
(`separate installation required <https://github.com/jlvdb/yet_another_wizz_cli>`_).
This tool provides subcommands for every major task. A first overview of its
features can be obtained from the built-in help tool:

.. literalinclude:: cmd/yaw_help_.txt
    :caption: ``$ yaw_cli --help``
    :language: none
