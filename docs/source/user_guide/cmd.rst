Command line tools
==================

The `yet_another_wizz` package can be used from a single command line tool
called ``yaw``. This tool provides subcommands for every major task. A first
overview of its features can be obtained from the built-in help tool:

.. code-block:: console

    yaw --help

.. literalinclude:: yaw_help.txt
    :language: none


Project directories
-------------------

All these subcommands have in common that they operate


.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    cmd/init
    cmd/scripts
    cmd/merging
    cmd/pipeline
    cmd/default_setup
