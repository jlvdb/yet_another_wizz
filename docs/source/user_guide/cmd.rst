Command line tools
==================

.. Note::

    This is a stub, more content coming soon.

The `yet_another_wizz` package can be used from a single command line tool
called ``yaw``. This tool provides subcommands for every major task. A first
overview of its features can be obtained from the built-in help tool:

.. literalinclude:: cmd/yaw_help_.txt
    :caption: ``$ yaw --help``
    :language: none


.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    cmd/init
    cmd/projdir
    cmd/scripts
    cmd/pipeline
    cmd/default_setup
    cmd/merging
