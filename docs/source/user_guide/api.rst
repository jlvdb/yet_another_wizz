Python API tutorial
===================

The most flexible way to use yet_another_wizz is to make use of its python API.
The python package can be imported with:

>>> import yaw

The top level of the package exposes the most commonly used objects, the data
catalogs, correlation functions, and data containers used to wrap the main data
products, such as clustering redshift estimates.

This introduction starts off with an easy example on how to use package before
explaining some of most import concepts in greater detail.
