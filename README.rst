yet_another_wizz
================


*yet_another_wizz* is a python package to efficiently compute cross-correlation
redshifts, also know as clustering redshifts and is hosted on github:

- code: https://github.com/jlvdb/yet_another_wizz.git
- docs: https://yet-another-wizz.readthedocs.io/
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/yet_another_wizz/

The method allows to estimate the unknown redshift distribution of a galaxy
sample by correlating the on-sky positions with a reference sample with known
redshifts. This implementation is based on the single bin correlation
measurement of the correlation amplitude, introduced by Schmidt et al. (2013,
`arXiv:1303.0292 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0292>`_).

Installation
------------

The yet_another_wizz package can be installed directly with pip::

    pip install yet_another_wizz

This will install the python package ``yaw``, as well as the ``yaw`` executable
command line tool.


Usage
-----

There are two main ways to use yet_another_wizz,

- the ``yaw`` commmand line tool and
- the python package ``yaw`` directly.

Most people will probably get started with the command line tool, which should
cover all necessary tasks for a standard clustering redshift calibration. For
custom solutions, use the python package. A basic example as well as the API
reference can be found in the official documentation.
