`yet_another_wizz` is a python package to efficiently compute cross-correlation
redshifts, also know as clustering redshifts. The method allows to estimate the
unknown redshift distribution of a galaxy sample by measuring the amplitude of
the angular correlation of the galaxy positions with those of a reference
sample with known redshifts.

This implementation is based on the idea (introduced by
Schmidt et al. 2013, see `arXiv:1303.0292 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0292>`_)
to measure the amplitude of the angular correlation functions by counting galaxy
pairs in a single, wide angular bin.

The code base, documentation and, python package are distributed at:

- code: https://github.com/jlvdb/yet_another_wizz.git
- docs: https://yet-another-wizz.readthedocs.io/
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/yet_another_wizz/

**Note:**
In the latest version, the code has been redesigned for large data sets and now
supports paralellism with MPI.

**Citing:**
When using this code in published work, please cite
*van den Busch et al. (2020), A&A 642, A200*
(`arXiv:2007.01846 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01846>`_)


Installation
------------

The `yet_another_wizz` package, which ships the python library ``yaw``, can be
installed directly with `pip`::

    pip install yet_another_wizz

To enable MPI support, the MPI runtime-environment must be installed and
configured. The easiest way to install `yet_another_wizz` with MPI enabled is
using the provided setup for `conda`::

    conda install -f environment.yml

This will creates a new environment called ``yaw`` and install the code together
with the ``openmpi`` implementation of MPI.

Alternative use the pip install option::

    pip install yet_another_wizz[mpi]

Other optional dependencies (not installed by default) are:

- ``matplotlib`` to enable plotting methods.
- ``healpy`` to enable generating random samples based on `HealPix` masks.


Usage
-----

For more information about how to use the python code, please refer to the usage
examples in the official documentation.

There is also a `plugin interface <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/rail_yaw>`_
for the Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers
(`RAIL <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/rail>`_) pipeline.

Previous versions of `yet_another_wizz` could also be run as a command line tool
when installing the sparate command-line client `yet_another_wizz_cli`. This
tool is deprecated as of version 3.0 but maybe be integrated directly into
`yet_another_wizz` in a future release.

For bug reports or requesting new features, please use the repository's
`GitHub issues page <https://github.com/jlvdb/yet_another_wizz/issues>`_.
