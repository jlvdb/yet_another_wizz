*yet_another_wizz* is a python package to efficiently compute cross-correlation
redshifts, also know as clustering redshifts and is hosted on github:

- code: https://github.com/jlvdb/yet_another_wizz.git
- docs: https://yet-another-wizz.readthedocs.io/
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/yet_another_wizz/

The method allows to estimate the unknown redshift distribution of a galaxy
sample by correlating the on-sky positions with a reference sample with known
redshifts. This implementation is based on the single bin correlation
measurement of the correlation amplitude, introduced by Schmidt et al. (2013,
`arXiv:1303.0292 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0292>`_).

.. Note::
    When using this code in published work, please cite
    *van den Busch et al. (2020), A&A 642, A200*
    (`arXiv:2007.01846 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01846>`_)


Installation
------------

The yet_another_wizz package can be installed directly with pip::

    pip install yet_another_wizz

This will install the python library ``yaw``.

Commandline tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There also exists a separate command line tool called
`yet_another_wizz_cli <https://github.com/jlvdb/yet_another_wizz_cli>`_
(``yaw_cli``) that is available at PyPI and github. To install it alongside the
python library, type::

    pip install yet_another_wizz[cli]

LSST-DESC RAIL plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently there is also a
`plugin interface <https://github.com/jlvdb/yet_another_wizz_rail>`_  for the
Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers
(`RAIL <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/rail>`_) pipeline under development. To
install it alongside the python library, including ``rail`` itself, type::

    pip install yet_another_wizz[rail]


Usage
-----

There are two main ways to use yet_another_wizz,

- the python library ``yaw`` itself and
- the (separate) ``yaw_cli`` commmand line tool.
- the (separate) ``yaw_rail`` RAIL plugin (coming soon).

Most users will probably get started with the command line tool, which should
cover all necessary tasks for a standard clustering redshift calibration. For
custom solutions, use the python library. A basic example as well as the API
reference can be found in the official documentation.
